# TrackAnything
This application will help you with gathering data from your life to make better decisions. 

The guide will set up a tracking system and graphs will show trends. 

Examples may be:
- how much sleep are you getting?
- How much can you lift, bro?
- How often do you feel happy? 
- Are you keeping up with your New Year's resolutions?
- When was the last time you reached out to your best friend?


The wizard will provide examples as well as having an open functionality to create your own programs

There will be an ad hoc entry option and a notification option.

There will be a randomization option so that the effect isn't predictable (reaching out to old friends for example).

MVP:
This goal is to get something up and running. Make it modular. Improve.
